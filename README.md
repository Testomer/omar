# OMAR AI Studio (Mock)

This is a simulated, single-page portfolio app built with Next.js 14 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. All AI behaviors are mocked and labeled as "Gemini 2.5 Flash (mock)".

How to run (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\PC\omar-ai-studio
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

The project contains UI components that simulate agentic features: terminal streaming, multi-modal indicator, simulated code execution, data grounding logs, and a settings mock for model tuning.
